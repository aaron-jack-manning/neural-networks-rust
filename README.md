# Neural Networks Rust

This repository currently contains some code for a feedforward neural network written in Rust. Ultimately, this code will be used for an explanation I am working on for building a feedforward neural network in Rust from scratch, and the underlying mathematics involved. The code in `feedforward` is the first iteration of the network, which will be simplified/cleaned up to then use as the code behind the explanations. There will also be a section on optimising the code, which will result in a separate project starting with the code from the first.
